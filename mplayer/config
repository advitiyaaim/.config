#
# MPlayer configuration file
#
# Configuration files are read system-wide from /usr/local/etc/mplayer.conf
# and per-user from ~/.mplayer/config, where per-user settings override
# system-wide settings, all of which are overrriden by the command line.
#
# The configuration file settings are the same as the command line
# options without the preceding '-'.
#
# See the CONFIGURATION FILES section in the man page
# for a detailed description of the syntax.
#
# Profiles should be placed at the bottom of the configuration file to ensure
# that settings wanted as defaults are not restricted to specific profiles.
